**This platform is developed in stages;** the first and current version of the MVP (minimum viable product) demonstrates a backend developed in Node.js with CRUD operations for user accounts stored on a cloud-based MongoDB. Interaction with the external Google API REST service is used for querying book information allowing this information to be added to user's accounts.  
Concerning security mechanisms, the users' information follows salted and hash-based authentication.  

#### To be added
* Securing the database with role-based policies.
* Serving the application over HTTPS.
* Error handling with REST add right errors, such as if staments (404)
