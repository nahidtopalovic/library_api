## About

CLUBLIT! is a drop-in-audio social media for book lovers and a platform that unites all readers to discuss their favorite novels and engage with fellow readers and authors in a community.
We bring great minds together to discuss and share their reading experiences through co-reading, live readings, and online audio events.
Our app assists you with the search for new potential reads and creates your customized wish lists.

**Note:** Not all features are available in the current release. This platform is developed in stages; the first and current version of the MVP (minimum viable product) demonstrates a backend developed in Node.js with CRUD operations for user accounts stored on a cloud-based MongoDB. Interaction with the external Google API REST service is used for querying book information allowing this information to be added to user's accounts. Concerning security mechanisms, the users' information follows salted and hash-based authentication. Furthermore, all our current cloud deployments have an RSA TLS (Azure) and SHA2 (Heroku) signed HTTPS certificate. Our `https` branch in this repository contains a self-signed HTTPS certificate for local deployments.

## System Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/nahidtopalovic/library_api/blob/main/media/architecture/cloud-clublit.png" />
</p>
The front-end serves as a seamless user interface for IOS 14 and android (planned in a future release).
The backend is a REST-based service interface for CRUD operations (for example, data query of books, user sign up & login, POST, PUT) deployed via Elastic Beanstalk to AWS to facilitate scalable performance and Microsoft Azure as well as Heroku. The node server interacts with Google Books API. Furthermore, our system uses a NoSQL external Cloud database (MongoDB) to securely store our community user information (salted and hashed).

## Backend

It is advisable to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for CRUD operations when acccessing the backend.

### Cloud App

Our current backend is accessible as a cloud application :rocket: on [Google Cloud](#google-cloud), [Azure](#microsoft-azure) and [Heroku](#heroku).
Feel free to check them out!

#### Google Cloud

[![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](http://35.233.107.125:3000)

This is our load balanced deployment!

To deploy a load-balanced application with Kubernetes, the following approach can be followed by having logged into the cloud console and created a new project.

##### Pre-Checks

First, launch the cloud shell and clone the repository by:

```
git clone https://github.com/nahidtopalovic/library_api.git
```

Navigate into the repository by typing

```
cd library-api
```

Verify your project ID (note you must change `PROJECT_ID` with your project ID, which can be found by typing `gloud projects list`)

```
export PROJECT_ID= PROJECT_ID
```

Once applied, test it with the following command.

```
export PROJECT_ID= PROJECT_ID
```

Now you may copy-paste the following commands without adjusting.

##### Creating the Docker Image

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/2019-07/horizontal-logo-monochromatic-white.png" height="40" />
</p>
Create our docker image with the "Dockerfile" from our repository by:

```
docker build -t gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/clublit:v1 .
```

List your Docker images to verify.

```
docker images
```

##### Pushing the Docker image to the Container Registry

Now we are required to enable the [Container Registy API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/containerregistry.googleapis.com); please note that this may require further adjustments from your API settings to turn on the Kubernetes API (check out the Google Cloud [API manager](https://cloud.google.com/apis)).

```
gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
```

Furthermore, we need to authorize the docker configuration.

```
gcloud auth configure-docker
```

Now we push the image

```
docker push gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/clublit:v1
```

#### Creating a GKE cluster

Setting the project ID:

```
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
```

Setting the zone or region (Europe as an example, adjust to your needs).

```
gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-b
```

Creating our Standard Cluster:

```
gcloud container clusters create clublit-cluster
```

Checking the cluster's three nodes

```
kubectl get nodes
```

#### Deploying CLUBLIT! to GKE

Ensuing the connection to the appropriate cluster:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials clublit-cluster --zone europe-west1-b
```

Creating the deployment

```
kubectl create deployment clublit --image=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/clublit:v1
```

Setting a baseline to three deployment replicas

```
kubectl scale deployment clublit --replicas=3
```

Creating a HorizontalPodAutoscaler:

```
kubectl autoscale deployment clublit --cpu-percent=80 --min=1 --max=5
```

Checking if our pods are created successfully:

```
kubectl get pods
```

#### Exposing CLUBLIT! to the internet

In our case, we require port 3000, as our development .env file contains information to connect to MongoDB set to port 3000.

```
kubectl expose deployment clublit --name=clublit-service --type=LoadBalancer --port 3000 --target-port 3000
```

Verify that the services are running :

```
kubectl get service
```

Note that it may require you to wait until you can see your public IP address if it is saying `<pending>`.

#### Delete the Service, Cluster & Images

If you are done testing our educational application you may follow these steps:

```
kubectl delete service clublit-service
```

```
gcloud container clusters delete clublit-cluster --zone europe-west1-b
```

```
gcloud container images delete gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/clublit:v1  --force-delete-tags --quiet
```
